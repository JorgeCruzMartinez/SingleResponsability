Example 4 first SOLID principle

## Description
Many design patterns were developed with SOLID principles in mind and therefore it will be hard to learn about them unless we know SOLID principles, so precisely the purpose of it is to show the evolution of code for the first principle in the book titled "The easiest way to learn design patterns With C#" and learn about what is needed to be done in order to avoid setting all the functionality ONLY in one place.
